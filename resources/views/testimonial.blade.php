                    <h6>Perfect Chiavari Chairs & Wonderful Staff</h6>
                    <p>I just want to thank the staff at All Occasion Rentals The Chiavari chairs were the perfect addition to my wedding receptions! They added to the elegance of the decor and made the room look bigger and brighter. All Occasion Rentals staff worked so well with me to pick the perfect chair/cushion combination to compliment the linens and flowers I had chosen for my special day. I have gotten so many compliments on choosing Chiavari chairs!
                        Thanks a million!

                    <h6>Our wedding day</h6>
                    <p>My husband and I planned the wedding of our dreams at All Occasion Rentals the summer of 2015. Our ceremony took place at dusk under a large, 100+ year old oak tree. It was breathtaking. Cocktail hour drinks and hours'devours were served in the club house, and the reception lead out to the driving range. It was open and airy, strung with market lights and perfect for our 200+ guests.
                        Mike, and Samantha, my day of coordinator, were so helpful and flexible. They let me customize the space down to every detail - and all the rentals which is hard to find now a days!
                        I honestly couldn't imagine a better rentals company for my wedding day. Every detail turned out better then I dreamed - photos of our wedding were featured on WeddingChicks com! "chic-rustic-glam-wedding"</p>
